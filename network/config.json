This shows some similarities with the results found by using SOM and Ward even though the network was based only in three of eight topics. Above is described each cluster to guide the user:\n********************************************************************************************************************************************************************* \nCluster 0 (Orange): It is characterized by the topics “Health Management Education”, “Land_cover/Maps/Urbanism/Populations/Environmental” and “GIS/Spatial/Smart_cities/Maps/Technology”; Most of the theses in this cluster are from “Geospatial Technologies”, “Geographic Information Systems and Science” and “Clinical Research Management”. \n********************************************************************************************************************************************************************* \nCluster 1 (Dark blue): It is characterized by the topics “Customer_satisfaction_\u0026_behaviour/Marketing/Products/Brands” and “Busines/Customers/Companies/Management/Technology”; Most of the theses in this cluster are from “Marketing Intelligence” and “Marketing Research and CRM”. The cluster also has some theses from “Information Systems and Technologies Management”, “Knowledge Management and Business Intelligence” and “Data Science and Advanced Analytics”. \n********************************************************************************************************************************************************************* \nCluster 2 (Green): It is characterized by the topic “Busines/Customers/Companies/Management/Technology”; Most of the theses in this cluster are from “Information Systems and Technologies Management” and “Knowledge Management and Business Intelligence”. The cluster also has some theses from “Data Science and Advanced Analytics”. The theses in this cluster have many connections with other theses and diversity of topics. \n********************************************************************************************************************************************************************* \nCluster 3 (Sky blue): It is characterized by the topics “GIS/Spatial/Smart_cities/Maps/Technology” and “Busines/Customers/Companies/Management/Technology”; Most of the theses in this cluster are from “Geospatial Technologies”, “Geographic Information Systems and Science” and some theses from “Knowledge Management and Business Intelligence”. \n********************************************************************************************************************************************************************* \nCluster 4 (Lilac): It is characterized by the topic “Machine_learning_algorithms” and has some weight on “Busines/Customers/Companies/Management/Technology” and “GIS/Spatial/Smart_cities/Maps/Technology”; Most of the theses in this cluster are from “Data Science and Advanced Analytics”, “Geospatial Technologies”. The cluster also has some theses from “Knowledge Management and Business Intelligence” and “Risk Analysis and Management”. \n********************************************************************************************************************************************************************* \nCluster 5 (Red): It is characterized by the topics “Risk/Bank/Insurance/Investiments/Marks/Law” and “Busines/Customers/Companies/Management/Technology”; Most of the theses in this cluster are from “Risk Analysis and Management”, “Law and Financial Markets” and “Information Systems and Technologies Management”.\n",
